# da-dojo
The CSS Dojo project exists as a demostration of applied CSS concepts,
both basic and advanced. You cannot visit it at this time, but it will soon be up and running.

To demo on this project locally, clone it, then run `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2).
